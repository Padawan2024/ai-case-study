<span style="font-size:14;">On October 2021, GitHub released an AI pair programmer called Copilot. Github wanted to create an AI coding assistant that would help write code faster and with less effort to allow developers to focus more of their energy on problem solving and collaboration. By drawing context from comments and code, Copilot can suggest single lines of code for autocompletion or entire functions for coding languages such as Python, JavaScript, Typescript, Ruby, Go, C# and C++ ( ). Copilot is currently available as an extension for Neovim, VS Code, Visual Studio and the family of Jet IDEs. Interested in learning more about Github Copilot? Watch the video below:</span>

According to Thomas Dohmke, it is part of GitHub’s mission to build technology that makes developers happy (2024). In a GitHub article, Eirini Kalliamvakou argues that developers’ satisfaction and productivity is linked to the ability to make meaningful progress and feeling good at the end of the day. Kalliamvakou cites other academic research that shows that these outcomes are important for developers and that satisfied developers perform better [ ].
To measure the effects of GitHub copilot, GitHub surveyed 2,000 developers about their experience using Copilot. They designed their research approach based on the three points mentioned below (Kalliamvakou, 2024): 
<p style="text-align: center"><b>Look at productivity holistically.</b></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>Include developers’ first-hand perspective.</b></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>Assess GitHub Copilot’s effects in everyday development scenarios.</b></p>

The results from the survey are shown below:

</div>

From the survey results, Kalliamvakou reported that between 60-75% of users "felt more fulfilled with their job, felt less frustrated when coding, and were able to focus on more satisfying work". Additionally, 73% of developers reported that copilot helped them stay in the flow and 83% reported that helped preserve mental effort. 
In the survey, GitHub observed that developers reported that Copilot helped them to complete tasks faster. To measure the effect in practice, they conducted a controlled experiment with 95 developers, where 45 used copilot and 50 did not. The results of the experiment are presented below:

According to Kalliamvakou, the results demonstrated the group that used Copilot had a higher rate of completing the task. She also mentions that developers using Copilot completed the task approximately 55% faster than developers not using it.
